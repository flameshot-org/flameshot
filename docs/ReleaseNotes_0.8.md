### Pixelate
The behavior of the blur tool has been modified so if the "thickness" is 0 or 1, the old blur behavior is preserved. If the thickness is increased past 1 the image will pixelate by the thickness:

### Countertool
A popular request has been to add a tool that counts upward. This can be helpful when creating directions.

### Sidebar
A button has been added to open the sidebar. This tool was previously only accessible by hitting "Spacebar" which made usage on tablets difficult. This sidebar allows advanced modifications for many tools.
