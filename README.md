## Features

- Customizable appearance.
- Easy to use.
- In-app screenshot editing.
- DBus interface.
- Upload to Imgur.

## Usage

Executing the command `flameshot` without parameters will launch a running
instance of the program in background without taking actions.
If your desktop environment provides tray area, a tray icon will also
appear in the tray for users to perform configuration and management.

Example commands:

- Capture with GUI:

    ```shell
    flameshot gui
    ```

- Capture with GUI with custom save path:

    ```shell
    flameshot gui -p ~/myStuff/captures
    ```

- Capture with GUI after 2 seconds delay (can be useful to take screenshots of mouse hover tooltips, etc.):

    ```shell
    flameshot gui -d 2000
    ```

- Fullscreen capture with custom save path (no GUI) and delayed:

    ```shell
    flameshot full -p ~/myStuff/captures -d 5000
    ```

- Fullscreen capture with custom save path copying to clipboard:

    ```shell
    flameshot full -c -p ~/myStuff/captures
    ```

- Capture the screen containing the mouse and print the image (bytes) in PNG format:

    ```shell
    flameshot screen -r
    ```

- Capture the screen number 1 and copy it to the clipboard:

    ```shell
    flameshot screen -n 1 -c
    ```

In case of doubt choose the first or the second command as shortcut in your favorite desktop environment.

A systray icon will be in your system's panel while Flameshot is running.
Do a right click on the tray icon and you'll see some menu items to open the configuration window and the information window.
Check out the About window to see all available shortcuts in the graphical capture mode.

### CLI configuration

You can use the graphical menu to configure Flameshot, but alternatively you can use your terminal or scripts to do so.

- Open the configuration menu:

    ```shell
    flameshot config
    ```

- Show the initial help message in the capture mode:

    ```shell
    flameshot config --showhelp true
    ```

- For more information about the available options use the help flag:

    ```shell
    flameshot config -h
    ```

### Config file
You can also edit some of the settings (like overriding the default colors) in the configuration file located at `~/.config/flameshot/flameshot.ini`.


## Keyboard shortcuts

### Local

These shortcuts are available in GUI mode:

<kbd>Shift</kbd> + drag a handler of the selection area: mirror redimension in the opposite handler.

### Global

If you want use Flameshot as a default screenshot utility, chances are you want to launch it using the <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd> key. Flameshot doesn't yet offer a fully-automated option to do so, but you can configure your system to do so.

#### On KDE Plasma desktop

To make configuration easier, there's a [file](docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde) in the repository that more or less automates this process. This file will assign the following keys to the following actions by default:

|  Keys                                                  |  Description                                                                       |
|---                                                     |---                                                                                 |
| <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>                                      | Start the Flameshot screenshot tool and take a screenshot                          |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>                    | Wait for 3 seconds, then start the Flameshot screenshot tool and take a screenshot |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>                   | Take a full-screen (all monitors) screenshot and save it                           |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd> | Take a full-screen (all monitors) screenshot and copy it to the clipboard          |

If you don't like the defaults, you can change them manually later.

Steps for using the configuration:

1. The configuration file configures shortcuts so that Flameshot automatically saves (without opening the save dialog) screenshots to `~/Pictures/Screenshots` folder. Make sure you have that folder by running the following command:

    ```shell
    mkdir -p ~/Pictures/Screenshots
    ```

    (If you don't like the default location, you can skip this step and configure your preferred directory later.)
2. Download the configuration file:

    ```shell
    cd ~/Desktop
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/master/docs/shortcuts-config/flameshot-shortcuts-kde
    ```
3. Go to _System Settings_ → _Shortcuts_ → _Custom Shortcuts_.
4. If there's one, you'll need to disable an entry for Spectacle, the default KDE screenshot utility first because its shortcuts might collide with Flameshot's ones; so, just uncheck the _Spectacle_ entry.
5. Click _Edit_ → _Import..._, navigate to the Desktop folder (or wherever you saved the configuration file) and open the configuration file.
6. Now the Flameshot entry should appear in the list. Click _Apply_ to apply the changes.
7. If you want to change the defaults, you can expand the entry, select the appropriate action and modify it as you wish; the process is pretty mush self-explanatory.

#### On Ubuntu (Tested on 18.04, 20.04)

To use Flameshot instead of the default screenshot application in Ubuntu we need to remove the binding on <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd> key, and then create a new binding for `/usr/bin/flameshot gui` ([adaptated](https://askubuntu.com/posts/1039949/revisions) from [Pavel's answer on AskUbuntu](https://askubuntu.com/revisions/1036473/1)). 

1. Remove the binding on <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd> using the following command.

  ```shell
  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys screenshot '[]'
  ```

2. Ubuntu 18.04: Go to Settings > Device > Keyboard and press the '+' button at the bottom.
   Ubuntu 20.04: Go to Settings > Keyboard and press the '+' button at the bottom.

3. Name the command as you like it, e.g. `flameshot`. And in the command insert `/usr/bin/flameshot gui`.

4. Then click "_Set Shortcut.._" and press <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>. This will show as "_print_".

Now every time you press <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd>, it will start the Flameshot GUI instead of the default application.


#### On XFCE 4

1. Go to `Keyboard` settings
2. Switch to the tab `Application Shortcuts`
3. Find the entry
        
    ```text
    Command                        Shortcut
    xfce4-screenshooter -fd 1      Print
    ````
4. Replace `xfce4-screenshooter -fd 1` with `flameshot gui`

Now every time you press <kbd>Prt Sc</kbd> it will start Flameshot GUI instead of the default application.


## Considerations

- Experimental Gnome Wayland and Plasma Wayland support.

- If you are using Gnome you need to install the [Gnome Shell Extension Appindicator](https://github.com/Ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator) extension in order to see the system tray icon.

- Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> when you are in a capture mode and you don't have an active selection and the whole desktop will be copied to your clipboard. Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> will save your capture to a file. Check the [Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) for more information.

- Flameshot works best with a desktop environment that includes D-Bus. See this [article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Flameshot#Troubleshooting) for tips on using Flameshot in a minimal window manager (dwm, i3, xmonad, etc).

- In order to speed up the first launch of Flameshot (D-Bus init of the app can be slow), consider starting the application automatically on boot.
    - Quick tip: If you don't have Flameshot to autostart at boot and you want to set keyboard shortcut, use the following as the command for the keybinding:
    ```sh
    ( flameshot &; ) && ( sleep 0.5s && flameshot gui )
    ```

## Installation

Flameshot can be installed on Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS.

### Prebuilt packages

Some prebuilt packages are provided on [the release page of the GitHub project repository](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/releases).

### Packages from Repository

There are packages available in the repository of some Linux distributions:

- [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/flameshot/): `pacman -S flameshot`

### Tray icon

**Note** that for the Flameshot icon to appear in your tray area, you should have a systray software installed. This is especially true for users who use minimal [window managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager) such as [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/). In some [Desktop Environment](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment) installations (e.g Gnome), the systray might be missing and you can install an application or plugin (e.g [Gnome shell extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1503/tray-icons/)) to add the systray to your setup. It has been [reported](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot/issues/1009#issuecomment-700781081)) that icon of some softwares, including Flameshot, does not show in [gnome-shell-extension-appindicator](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator).


Alternatively, in case you don't want to have a systray, you can always call Flameshot from the terminal. See [Usage section](#usage).


## Compilation

To build the application in your system, you'll need to install the dependencies needed for it and package names might be different for each distribution, see [Dependencies](#dependencies) below for more information. You can also install most of the Qt dependencies via [their installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer). If you were developing Qt apps before, you probably already have them.

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system, so you need to install it in order to build the project (on most Linux distributions it is available in the standard repositories as a package called `cmake`). If your distribution provides too old version of CMake (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04) you can [download it on the official website](https://cmake.org/download/).

Also you can open and build/debug the project in a C++ IDE. For example, in Qt Creator you should be able to simply open `CMakeLists.txt` via `Open File or Project` in the menu after installing CMake into your system. [More information about CMake projects in Qt Creator](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-cmake.html).
