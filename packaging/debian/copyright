License: Free-Art-License-1.3
 Free Art License 1.3 (FAL 1.3)
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The Free Art License grants the right to freely copy, distribute, and
 transform creative works without infringing the author's rights.
 .
 The Free Art License recognizes and protects these rights. Their
 implementation has been reformulated in order to allow everyone to use
 creations of the human mind in a creative manner, regardless of their
 types and ways of expression.
 .
 While the public's access to creations of the human mind usually is
 restricted by the implementation of copyright law, it is favoured by
 the Free Art License. This license intends to allow the use of a
 work’s resources; to establish new conditions for creating in order to
 increase creation opportunities. The Free Art License grants the right
 to use a work, and acknowledges the right holder’s and the user’s
 rights and responsibility.
 .
 The invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and
 Free Software have changed creation methods: creations of the human
 mind can obviously be distributed, exchanged, and transformed. They
 allow to produce common works to which everyone can contribute to the
 benefit of all.
 .
 The main rationale for this Free Art License is to promote and protect
 these creations of the human mind according to the principles of
 copyleft: freedom to use, copy, distribute, transform, and prohibition
 of exclusive appropriation.
 .
 Definitions
 .
 “work” either means the initial work, the subsequent works or the
 common work as defined hereafter:
 .
 “common work” means a work composed of the initial work and all
 subsequent contributions to it (originals and copies). The initial
 author is the one who, by choosing this license, defines the
 conditions under which contributions are made.
 .
 “Initial work” means the work created by the initiator of the common
 work (as defined above), the copies of which can be modified by
 whoever wants to
 .
 “Subsequent works” means the contributions made by authors who
 participate in the evolution of the common work by exercising the
 rights to reproduce, distribute, and modify that are granted by the
 license.
 .
 “Originals” (sources or resources of the work) means all copies of
 either the initial work or any subsequent work mentioning a date and
 used by their author(s) as references for any subsequent updates,
 interpretations, copies or reproductions.
 .
 “Copy” means any reproduction of an original as defined by this
 license.
 .
 1. OBJECT
 .
 The aim of this license is to define the conditions under which one
 can use this work freely.
 .
 2. SCOPE
 .
 This work is subject to copyright law. Through this license its author
 specifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute, and modify it.
 .
 2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO MAKE REPRODUCTIONS)
 .
 You have the right to copy this work for yourself, your friends or any
 other person, whatever the technique used.
 .
 2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO PERFORM IN PUBLIC
 .
 You have the right to distribute copies of this work; whether modified
 or not, whatever the medium and the place, with or without any charge,
 provided that you: attach this license without any modification to the
 copies of this work or indicate precisely where the license can be
 found, specify to the recipient the names of the author(s) of the
 originals, including yours if you have modified the work, specify to
 the recipient where to access the originals (either initial or
 subsequent).
 .
 The authors of the originals may, if they wish to, give you the right
 to distribute the originals under the same conditions as the copies.
 .
 2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY
 .
 You have the right to modify copies of the originals (whether initial
 or subsequent) provided you comply with the following conditions: all
 conditions in article 2.2 above, if you distribute modified copies;
 indicate that the work has been modified and, if it is possible, what
 kind of modifications have been made; distribute the subsequent work
 under the same license or any compatible license.
 .
 The author(s) of the original work may give you the right to modify it
 under the same conditions as the copies.
 .
 3. RELATED RIGHTS
 .
 Activities giving rise to author’s rights and related rights shall not
 challenge the rights granted by this license.
 .
 For example, this is the reason why performances must be subject to
 the same license or a compatible license. Similarly, integrating the
 work in a database, a compilation or an anthology shall not prevent
 anyone from using the work under the same conditions as those defined
 in this license.
 .
 4. INCORPORATION OF THE WORK
 .
 Incorporating this work into a larger work that is not subject to the
 Free Art License shall not challenge the rights granted by this
 license.
 .
 If the work can no longer be accessed apart from the larger work in
 which it is incorporated, then incorporation shall only be allowed
 under the condition that the larger work is subject either to the Free
 Art License or a compatible license.
 .
 5. COMPATIBILITY
 .
 A license is compatible with the Free Art License provided: it gives
 the right to copy, distribute, and modify copies of the work including
 for commercial purposes and without any other restrictions than those
 required by the respect of the other compatibility criteria; it
 ensures proper attribution of the work to its authors and access to
 previous versions of the work when possible; it recognizes the Free
 Art License as compatible (reciprocity); it requires that changes made
 to the work be subject to the same license or to a license which also
 meets these compatibility criteria.
 .
 6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS
 .
 This license does not aim at denying your author's rights in your
 contribution or any related right. By choosing to contribute to the
 development of this common work, you only agree to grant others the
 same rights with regard to your contribution as those you were granted
 by this license. Conferring these rights does not mean you have to
 give up your intellectual rights.
 .
 7. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
 .
 The freedom to use the work as defined by the Free Art License (right
 to copy, distribute, modify) implies that everyone is responsible for
 their own actions.
 .
 8. DURATION OF THE LICENSE
 .
 This license takes effect as of your acceptance of its terms. The act
 of copying, distributing, or modifying the work constitutes a tacit
 agreement. This license will remain in effect for as long as the
 copyright which is attached to the work. If you do not respect the
 terms of this license, you automatically lose the rights that it
 confers.
 .
 If the legal status or legislation to which you are subject makes it
 impossible for you to respect the terms of this license, you may not
 make use of the rights which it confers.
 .
 9. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE
 .
 This license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate
 improvements by its authors (instigators of the “Copyleft Attitude”
 movement) by way of new, numbered versions.
 .
 You will always have the choice of accepting the terms contained in
 the version under which the copy of the work was distributed to you,
 or alternatively, to use the provisions of one of the subsequent
 versions.
 .
 10. SUB-LICENSING
 .
 Sub-licenses are not authorized by this license. Any person wishing to
 make use of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the
 authors of the common work.
 .
 11. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
 .
 This license is written with respect to both French law and the Berne
 Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.
 .

 It is the result of observing, using and creating digital

 Software community, artists, and members of the art world. The goal
 was to adapt the principles of Copyleft and free software to all sorts
 of creations. http://www.artlibre.org
