Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to combine this library with independent
modules to produce an executable, and to copy and distribute the resulting
executable under terms of any of the GNU General Public licenses, as published
by the Free Software Foundation, provided that you also meet,
for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of
that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this
exception to your version of the library, but you are not obliged to do so.
If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
