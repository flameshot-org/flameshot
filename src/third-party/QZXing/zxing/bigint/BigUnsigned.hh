	/*
	 * BigUnsigned and BigInteger both provide three kinds of operators.
	 * Here ``big-integer'' refers to BigInteger or BigUnsigned.
	 *
	 * (1) Overloaded ``return-by-value'' operators:
	 *     +, -, *, /, %, unary -, &, |, ^, <<, >>.
	 * Big-integer code using these operators looks identical to code using
	 * the primitive integer types.  These operators take one or two
	 * big-integer inputs and return a big-integer result, which can then
	 * be assigned to a BigInteger variable or used in an expression.
	 * Example:
	 *     BigInteger a(1), b = 1;
	 *     BigInteger c = a + b;
	 *
	 * (2) Overloaded assignment operators:
	 *     +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, flipSign, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=, ++, --.
	 * Again, these are used on big integers just like on ints.  They take
	 * one writable big integer that both provides an operand and receives a
	 * result.  Most also take a second read-only operand.
	 * Example:
	 *     BigInteger a(1), b(1);
	 *     a += b;
	 *
	 * (3) Copy-less operations: `add', `subtract', etc.
	 * These named methods take operands as arguments and store the result
	 * in the receiver (*this), avoiding unnecessary copies and allocations.
	 * `divideWithRemainder' is special: it both takes the dividend from and
	 * stores the remainder into the receiver, and it takes a separate
	 * object in which to store the quotient.  NOTE: If you are wondering
	 * why these don't return a value, you probably mean to use the
	 * overloaded return-by-value operators instead.
	 * 
	 * Examples:
	 *     BigInteger a(43), b(7), c, d;
	 *
	 *     c = a + b;   // Now c == 50.
	 *     c.add(a, b); // Same effect but without the two copies.
	 *
	 *     c.divideWithRemainder(b, d);
	 *     // 50 / 7; now d == 7 (quotient) and c == 1 (remainder).
	 *
	 *     // ``Aliased'' calls now do the right thing using a temporary
	 *     // copy, but see note on `divideWithRemainder'.
	 *     a.add(a, b);
