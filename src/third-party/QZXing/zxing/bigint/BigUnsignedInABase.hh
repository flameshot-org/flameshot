/*
 * A BigUnsignedInABase object represents a nonnegative integer of size limited
 * only by available memory, represented in a user-specified base that can fit
 * in an `unsigned short' (most can, and this saves memory).
 *
 * BigUnsignedInABase is intended as an intermediary class with little
 * functionality of its own.  BigUnsignedInABase objects can be constructed
 * from, and converted to, BigUnsigneds (requiring multiplication, mods, etc.)
 * and `std::string's (by switching digit values for appropriate characters).
 *
 * BigUnsignedInABase is similar to BigUnsigned.  Note the following:
 *
 * (1) They represent the number in exactly the same way, except that
 * BigUnsignedInABase uses ``digits'' (or Digit) where BigUnsigned uses
 * ``blocks'' (or Blk).
 *
 * (2) Both use the management features of NumberlikeArray.  (In fact, my desire
 * to add a BigUnsignedInABase class without duplicating a lot of code led me to
 * introduce NumberlikeArray.)
 *
 * (3) The only arithmetic operation supported by BigUnsignedInABase is an
 * equality test.  Use BigUnsigned for arithmetic.
